Spike sorting for the Frank Laboratory at UCSF
==============================================

== BASIC USAGE ==

1. Put the raw data into the raw directory.
For example: raw/ms11d45.dat and raw/ms11.prb

2. Run do_processing.m
This will create files in output/detect
There are some configuration strings inside the script

3. Run do_view.m
Manipulate the script to view the results for different channels

== ADVANCED USAGE ==

To view the events/labels in the context of the raw dataset you
will want to compile "spikespy", a Qt GUI, using the instructions below.
Once compiled, you can launch the program by clicking on the button
at the bottom of one of the output windows generated by do_view.m.

== COMPILING SPIKESPY ==

See spikespy/README.txt

You will need to install Qt4 or Qt5 development environment
